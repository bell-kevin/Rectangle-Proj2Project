# Rectangle-Proj2Project
SDEV 1060 Project. In the reading about Getting Started, you created a project for a Box object with length and width that included methods for area and perimeter of rectangles. You will modify and enhance that project so that the flat 2D objects become boxes with 3 dimensions -- length, width, and height. Add a third instance variable for height, and a third parameter in the constructor for that variable. Add a method for volume of the box, which is calculated as length * width * height.  In the project code, fix the constructor for the box object so it includes all 3 dimensions. In the main method, add a question to ask the user for the height, and to print out the volume as well as area and perimeter in the Main method. Create a set of 5 test cases for valid data (the "happy path"). The tests should show the length, width, height, and the results for the calculation the perimeter (2 * length + 2 * width), area (length * width), and volume (length * width * height). NOTE: the test cases cannot include the data shown in the example here.  Update the unit test file to include a test for the volume. Make sure all 3 tests pass with the values of length = 12, width = 8, height = 10 (sample shown above). Take a screenshot of the running program, like the example above (you only need one). Take a screenshot of the results of the test, with the code that shows the test values. Repeat the tests for each of the 5 test cases you wrote for this assignment. For each test, take a screenshot of the test file with results for each new test, as shown above. Remember that you cannot use the same data as shown in this example in your test cases and screenshots.     Submission: document with the test cases, screenshot of the running program, 5 screenshots of the code with passing tests, and the root folder for the project 

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==  This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop our FOSS project.  We have an [open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.  If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please [check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without using GitHub directly.  Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.  ![Logo of the GiveUpGitHub campaign](https://sfconservancy.org/img/GiveUpGitHub.png)
